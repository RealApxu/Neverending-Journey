Unofficial expansion set to Baldur’s Gate II

PLEASE READ THIS ATTENTIVELY BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER:

LICENSE AGREEMENT

This unofficial expansion set, which is tentatively called ‘modification’, is the totally independent product. Neither this product, nor the authors are authorised or sponsored by, nor licensed or affiliated in any way with any entity involved with or representing the development, marketing, distribution or support of Interplay Productions, Black Isle Studios or BioWare Corporation. All titles, items, characters and art found, implemented, described or referred to in this ‘modification’ of the original game are trademarks of their respective companies. This expansion set is absolutely non-commercial and non-profit, and may not be distributed in any forms or in any parts without prior consent of the authors.


1. INSTALLATION

- First of all, make the backup of your original OVERRIDE folder, and the DIALOG.TLK file located in your main installation directory, in advance.
- Please ensure that your current DIALOG.TLK file is not write protected (Read-Only). If this is the case you should first remove the corresponding *Read-Only* flag in file attributes (properties).
- To install this add-on is very simple. You will need a clean installation of Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal and the latest ToB official patch 26498.
- My Compilation v2.0 including Original Baldurdash fixes v1.12 (by Kevin Dorner) are strongly recommended, and should be installed prior to installation of NeJ2.
- Launch the setup program (Setup-NeJ2v702.EXE), and extract the archive into your main BG2 installation folder, which is C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII – SoA by default.
- After the archive is extracted and the setup program is automatically launched in a DOS window, please follow on-screen instructions.
- After installation is finished you will be prompted to install the NoCD patch which I highly recommend to everyone. It will save your CDs for a long time.


2. UNINSTALLATION

To uninstall NeJ3, you need to launch Setup-NeJ2v65.EXE located in your main BG2 installation folder, and then in order to restore your previous installation please substitute the modified OVERRIDE folder, and DIALOG.TLK file with your backups.


3. HOW TO PLAY

You must start a new game from the very beginning... For more questions, please visit our forum boards at:

4. COMPATIBILITY

If you have already reached this point, you must understand that this expansion set is 100% compatible only with ToB. You may try to install all other mods ON TOP of this mod, and I am pretty sure that most of them will work fine if they are in a WeiDU installation format. The compatibility list may include many NPCs, items, tweaks mods, which should be compatible with NeJ2. However I would highly recommend to refrain from installing NeJ2 with other big mods. The big mods such as TDD, SoS and CtB are not compatible with NeJ2 at this time. The incompatibility issues may be minor, but also may be major. I would also recommend for those who want to install Imoen Romance to pay attention to our component "Continious & Custom Imoen", which you may choose not to install.

*Note: My Compilation must be installed prior to installation of NeJ3.

6. NOTES (by Hlidskialf, first edition, by Vlad, second edition):

By taking the portal immediately north of the starting area in Irencius' dungeon the party will travel through time and space to the land of Icewind Dale.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

It adds a human paladin kit called the Moon Knight:

MOON KNIGHT: This paladin kit was created especially for Hrothgar. *The Brotherhood Of Moon* is and ancient order of warriors seldom ever seen in Faerun. They are extremely disciplined, and have been specially trained to fight the undead and other unnatural creatures. However they are more mercenaries than knights. They believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and refuse to see actions as either good or evil.

Advantages:
- Immunity to hold and level drain
- Bonus +3 to hit and +3 to damage against undead
- May cast a limited selection of spells:
    Repulse Undead (at 10th, 15th, 20th and 25th level)
    False Dawn (at 15th, 21th, 27th and 33th level)
    Protection from magical weapons (at 12th, 20th and 28th level)
    Mantle (at 14th, 24th and 34th level)
    Protection from magic energy (at 16th and 28th level)
    Anti-magic (at 21th and 36th level)

Disadvantages:
- Can only be of neutral alignments

*Hrothgar has gained master class in axes.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

A cleric kit called the Priest of Ilmater:

PRIEST OF ILMATER: This kit was created especially for Dar. Ilmater, also known as the Crying God, is the god of suffering and perserverance. Taught that enduring the suffering of others is the greatest act of sacrifice, Painbearers of Ilmater can be found wherever the weak are oppressed. Painbearers are known for their charity, humility, and their unshaking faith during even the most trying of circumstances.

*Dar spent several years dwelling in mountains in a highland monastery where he gained special training in martial and spiritual curative arts.

Abilities:

- 'Hand of Ilmater' (thrice per day), fist attack which does 1d6 base damage and is treated as if the caster is a grand master. The Hand of Ilmater is treated as a regular weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels 25 and above. The Hand of Ilmater lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.
- 'Ilmater's Endurance' (once per day), doubles the hit points of the spell recipient for the spell duration. Any damage suffered is taken first from these phantom hit points until they are all exhausted; damage is then taken from the real hit points of the affected being. All saving throws receive a +2 bonus. In addition, no being protected by 'Ilmater's Endurance' can be knocked over, trampled, ridden down, or overthrown; all protected beings can stand firm against all charges.
- Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level (at 7th, 15th, 21th and 27th level)
- Immunity to all diseases.
- Cure disease (at 3th, 12th, 21th, and 30th level) 
- Neutralize poison (at 5th, 12th, 21th, and 27th level)
- Remove curse (at 6th, 12th and 18th level)
- Remove paralysis (at 6th, 12th and 18th level)
- Lesser restoration (at 10th and 20th level)
- Mass cure (at 14th and 24th level)
- Heal (at 15th and 22th level).
